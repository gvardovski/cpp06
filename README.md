cpp06 – A C++ module focusing on type conversions and casting 🔄✨

Contains three exercises:
🔹 ex00: Scalar type converter (char/int/float/double detection & conversion) 🧮
🔹 ex01: Pointer serialization/deserialization using reinterpret_cast 📦🔗
🔹 ex02: Runtime type identification (RTTI) with dynamic_cast and polymorphic class hierarchy (Base → A/B/C) 🎭🔍

Built with C++98 standard, strict compiler flags, and clean OOP design. Each exercise compiles independently via Makefile. 🛠️💻
